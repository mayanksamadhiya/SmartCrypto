The project submitted package containe the following files and foldeer:-


1. Documentation : The detailed report of the implementations and the protocols are given in the report enclosed as 			
		 Milan_Suresh_Mayank_Mohammad_Report.pdf

2. Presentation : The presentation of the protocols are given in Milan_Suresh_Mayank_Mohammad_ppt.pdf

3. Source Code : The source code of the File Encoder Application implementing the proposed Secure Channel Protocol are as under:-

	- /SymSec : 
		- Build the code /SymSec/PC_Application.v1.0_1/_source/FileEncoderApplication
		- The SymSec protocol is defined in the class files in /SymSec/PC_Application.v1.0_1/_source/FileEncoderApplication_SymSec1
		- The Jar filed already build is at /SymSec/PC_Application.v1.0_1/_source/FileEncoderApplication/dist

	- /SymSec/SimpleAPDU_setKey_PIN :
		- The project /SymSec/SimpleAPDU_setKey_PIN is used to set the Counter, AES Key and the PIN on the JAVA Card. The path to the 			files key.bin and count.bin generated by /SymSec/SimpleAPDU_setKey_PIN/src/simpleapdu/SimpleAPDU.java is 
		/SymSec/PC_Application.v1.0_1/_source/FileEncoderApplication_SymSec1
		- Copy the same files into the current directory of the jar file of project.

	-/AsymSec :
		- Build the code /SymSec/PC_Application.v1.0_1/_source/FileEncoderApplication
		- The SymSec protocol is defined in the class files in /SymSec/PC_Application.v1.0_1/_source/FileEncoderApplication_SymSec1
		- The Jar filed already build is at /SymSec/PC_Application.v1.0_1/_source/FileEncoderApplication/dist

	-/AsymSec/SimpleAPDU_setKey_PIN_Pass :
		- The project /SymSec/SimpleAPDU_setKey_PIN is used to set the Counter, AES Key, random password and the PIN on the JAVA 			Card. The path to the files key.bin and count.bin generated by /AsymSec/SimpleAPDU_setKey_PIN_Pass/src/		`		simpleapdu/SimpleAPDU.java is /AsymSec/PC_Application.v1.0_1/_source/FileEncoderApplication_AsymSec1
		- Copy the same files into the current directory of the jar file of project.

	- The SymSec Folder contains the simpleapdu folder. Make a copy of folder FileEncoderApplication and rename as 		
	FileEncoderApplication_SymSec1. Copy the simpleapdu folder into /PC_Application.v1.0_1/_source/FileEncoderApplication_SymSec1/src/com/
	hotmail/frojasg1/applications/fileencoderapplication.

	- The Symsec Folder also contains FileJInternalFrame.java. Copy the same into /PC_Application.v1.0_1/_source/FileEncoderApplication/
	src/com/hotmail/frojasg1/applications/fileencoderapplication.

	- The SymSec folder contains SimpleApplet.java which is the applet code to be installed on the Java Card.

	- Similar action required to be performed in AsymSec folder.
	
	- The CardMngr.java is also updated with added functions.
